## Usage / Reproducing Results

### XLM-R Formality Classifier

To reproduce the evaluation results for the `xlmr_formality_classifier` model:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Import or upload the notebook located at:

   `/xlm-roberta/xlm-roberta.ipynb`

3. Run all

The notebook handles loading the model, running predictions on the evaluation dataset, and computing Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation.
The part that exports results to Google Drive has been commented out for convenience.

### Squinky Formality Classifier

To reproduce results using the **Squinky** classifier:

1. First, install **Miniconda** (I strongly suggest installing the same version, since I tested it on this). On Windows, you can install it using Chocolatey:

   ```bash
   choco install miniconda3 --version=4.5.4
   ```

2. Open Anaconda Prompt (recommended) and navigate to the squinky directory in this project.

3. Create the Conda environment using the provided squinky_env.yml file:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f squinky_env.yml
   ```

4. Activate the environment:

   ```
   conda activate squinky_env
   ```

5. Reinstall the following dependencies, as some versions may be overridden during environment creation due to `pip` being used when installing Squinky:

   ```bash
   conda install --force numpy=1.13.3 scipy=0.19.0 mkl=2017.0.4 scikit-learn=0.18.1
   ```

6. Once the environment is active and dependencies are fixed, you can run the evaluation script:

   ```bash
   python predict_squinky.py
   ```
